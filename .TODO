Personal to-do for issues I couldn't be bothered to put on the board...

1. Load the token safely, preferably from an online vault, or at least from a file - currently at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications
2. Add messages resources rather than hardcoded messages

3. Add something like this for welcome cog

'''
@commands.Cog.listener()
    async def on_member_join(self, member: discord.Member):
        """
        TODO: Docs, proper code
        """
        Log.debug(f"{member.display_name} joined DoF discord for the first time")

        # TODO: Put this message into a different channel
        await self._bot.channels["bot-testing"].send(f"Welcome to DoF discord, {member.display_name}! Please type !help"
                                                     f" to learn more about the clan and possible commands!")
'''

4. Consider adding enums for application process - this way could override entire on_message bot functionality
depending on the application status (in case other private conversations should be added)
