Couldn't be bothered to make issues as of now, so here we go:

Load the token safely, preferably from an online vault
Write up apply.py
Write up setup.py
Figure out how to get specific context - at the moment command can be typed anywhere, would like to do different things depending on where was it typed - can now restrict to dm only
Add messages resource rather than hardcoded messages

Grab token from here
