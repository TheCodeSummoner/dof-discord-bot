Couldn't be bothered to make issues as of now, so here we go:

1. Load the token safely, preferably from an online vault
2. Write up apply.py
3. Setup logging
4. Write up setup.py
5. Figure out how to get specific context - at the moment command can be typed anywhere,
would like to do different things depending on where was it typed

Grab token from here
